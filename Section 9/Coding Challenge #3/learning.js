/* 3 sources of data
    1. From program itself : in sources code
    2. From UI : Dom
    3. From external(outside) sources  : API
    Data structor : Array or Sets and Obj or Maps ,... 
*/

/* When we are using array or Sets 
  Array: - When we need ordered list of value (might contain duplicate)
         - Use when u need to manipulate data     
  Sets: Use when u need to work with unique values
        Use when high-performance (hiệu suất) is really important like add set delete clear
        Use to remove duplicate from arrays      
*/
/* When we are using Object or Maps 
    Object: More 'tranditional'(Truyền thống) key/value store('Abused' Objs)
            Easier to write and access(get) value with . and [] (obj.data or obj['data'])

            Use when u need to include functions
            Use when working with json
    Map: Better performance
         Key can any data type
         Easy to iterate       
         Easy to compure size 

         Use when simply need to map key to value
         Use when u need key are not string
